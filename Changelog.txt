Cartographer, August 2021 Update - 1.17 Begins!

This is another optimization, clean up, and rework patch. But now, we're in 1.17! Wheeeeeeee!

Additions:

Custom Enchantments:
  - Added Cauterize (Passive):
    - Attack (Melee, Ranged, Thorns 2.0, Eruption) a mob on fire to cauterize it, cleansing fire, doing half the remaining burn damage instantly, and making the mob brittle.
    - For the remaining duration of fire, the mob is instead "Brittle"
    - Brittle mobs take 100% damage and bonus knockback from the next attack from a player. (The debuff is consumed).
    - Enemies immune to fire damage [note: not Fire Resistance] cannot be made brittle, but do always take 2.5 additional damage from the enchantment.

  - Added Singe (Melee):
    - Deal 2.5 bonus melee damage (per level) to enemies on Fire.
    - Enemies immune to fire damage automatically take the bonus damage.

  - Added Fleetfoot (Ranged):
    - Move at full movement speed while drawing back a bow, loading a crossbow, or aiming a trident.
  
  - Added Overcharge: (Ranged -> Bow):
    - Hold a bow for additional time (past maximum charge) to further increase the damage of the shot.
    - Increases by 50% (multiplicative of all bow effects) for each level (max of 3 levels)
    - Each level adds an additional 0.5 seconds to the maximum bonus charge.

Custom Statuses:
  - Added a Global Option to enable Critical Hits while players are Blind or Slow Falling.

Mob Abilities:

Introducing Ability Traits:
  - Ability traits now allow customization of the enemies' active effects.
  - Abilities such as all the Nova varieties no longer have said varieties, instead using this system.

Current Ability Traits:
  Damage Modifiers:
  - Ability Damage: The mob deals 0.5x / 0.75x / 1.5x / 2x damage with abilities (calculated from final amount).

  Cooldown Modifiers:
  - Ability Haste: Cooldowns are reduced by 25%/50% or increased by 25%/50%.

  On Hit Effects:
  - Blazing: The ability lights the ground beneath attacked players on fire.
  - Glacial: The ability applies a slow effect to the player which diminishes rapidly over time.
  - Overloading: The ability creates clouds of electric sparks around the player, which when walked into, weaken, fatigue, and damage entities.
  - Horrifying: The ability cripples players (slowing players, reducing their melee attack speed, and reducing their armor) temporarily.
  - Celestial: The ability heals the user for 50% of the damage value dealt to a player. (If a player was damaged)
  - Venemous: The ability poisons the attacked player. The poison ticks faster if the player has Saturation.
  - Zephyrous: The ability throws the attacked player into the air.

  Mob Effects:
  - Aftershock: The ability pulses a shockwave around the mob when finished. (50% of the Attack Damage stat)
  - Predator: The enemy leaps towards the nearest player if the player is out of melee range. If the player is within melee range, they leap away.
  - Evocative: The mob directs a path of evoker fangs at the nearest player.
  - Carapace: The mob creates a shield around it when it uses an ability. The shield grants it 30 armor and knockback immunity, lasting until the mob is attacked (or 10 seconds).
  - Volatile: The mob explodes when they cast the ability.

Old Traits (aka Passives) are now called "Passives"

New Actives:
  - Grenadier: The mob throws 3 grenades in the general direction it is facing. (50% of the mob's total attack damage per needle)
  - Needle: The mob fires 8 projectiles in quick succession in the general direction of the nearest player. (200% of the mob's total attack damage per grenade)
  - Rift: The mob charges up and after a delay, creates 3 equidistant shockwaves that travel away from the mob. (300% of the mob's total attack damage when hit)

New Passives:
  - Ambidextrous: The mob can swap between its main hand and offhand item based on distance to the player.
    - Alternative option: "ca.follow_up" - The mob swaps between its hands when it deals damage to a player instead.

  - Touch: The mob inflicts bonuses from any ability traits it has on melee/ranged attack.

  - Projectile Series:
    - These passives replace the existing shot projectile of a mob.
      - Shoot Fire Charge: Replaces projectiles with Fire Charges (aka small fireballs)
      - Shoot Fireball: Replaces projectiles with Fireballs (akin to ghasts)
      - Shoot Wither Skull: Replaces projectiles with Wither skulls
      - Shoot Dragon Fireball: Replaces projectiles with Dragon Fireballs
      - Shoot Shulker Bullet: Replaces projectiles with Shulker Bullets. Shulker Bullets can inflict 1 custom effects by copying custom potion data from the mob's offhand. (only 1)
      - Shoot Potion: Replaces projectile with Potion (potion data is copied from the mob's offhand)

  - Potion Bag (Witches)
    - Potions thrown are replaced (randomly) via potions placed in a hopper in the witch's offhand.
    - Potions drunk are replaced (randomly) via potions placed in a hopper in the witch's head slot.

  - Skin Series:
    - Fireskin: Receives Fire Resistance (0:20) every 20 seconds.
    - Waterskin: Receives Water Breathing (0:20) every 20 seconds.
    - Scaleskin: Receives Regeneration I/II/III (0:20) every 20 seconds.
    - Permacloak -> Shimmerskin (Duration is now 20 seconds every 20 seconds.)
    - Shroudskin: Receives Invisibility (0:20) every 20 seconds.

Changes:

Custom Enchantments:
  - All custom nbt of custom enchantments has been reformatted and revamped.

  - Some enchantments have received name changes in order to make them easier to understand and differentiate from other effects.
    - Vicious and Rend have been renamed to Bleeding and Bleed
    - Overload and Conductive have been renamed to Electrocute and Electrode
    - Decay and Putrefy have been renamed to Infection and Infect
    - Committed and Pin Down have been renamed to Exposing and Expose
    - Vanquisher has been renamed to "First Strike"
    - Volatile has been renamed to "Explosive"

  - Bleeding:
    - Duration of Bleeding status is always 3 seconds (adding 1 when adding more stacks)
    - Now increases the number of afflicted stacks by 1 per level. (1/2/3 stacks inflicted)

  - Bleed:
    - Now inflicts 4 seconds of Bleeding 2 (2 stacks)

  Developer Commentary: Bleeding has felt like a lackluster debuff compared to Shocked, Infection, and the new Cauterize. It was originally intended as a stacked
  debuff that you applied repeatedly to get bursty high damage DoT. Unfortunately, hitting a mob repeatedly already places it near death, failing to justify a high damage
  bursty DoT effects. Bleeding served much better as a hit and run effect where you would tag many enemies with stacks and allow the effect to lower their health while you
  prioritized other enemies or spawners. Bleeding related enchants are receiving the above changes to accent this playstyle. Bleeding (the status effect) is also receiving
  other changes (see below) to merge the original design into this playstyle.

  - Concealed:
    - No longer grants stealth upon time out of combat.
    - Grants stealth when you kill a mob. Starting at 3 seconds, and adding 1 second per level.
    - New max level: 6
    - On a Sapper pickaxe, spawners also make you invisible.
    - Damage buff reduced by 5% per armor piece worn. (Max of 50%, Minimum of 30%)

  Developer Commentary: Concealed while a great concept suffered from several issues. It was easy to abuse, and the playstyle didn't fit very well into Minecraft Combat.
  It has been refocused to act as another one of the "mob kill buff powers" which makes it feel more natural to use, and also reduces how well it can be abused. Additionally,
  wearing armor will lessen the attack penalty slightly so the item is not simply a large attack boost.

  - Electrode:
    - Duration of Shocked reduced to 4 seconds (from 5 seconds).

  - Flash:
    - Uses time charged on bow/crossbow load rather than arrow velocity for stun chance.
    - Chance to stun is always 100%.
    - Time to stun is now one third of the time drawn for (max stun time of 1 second).

  - Fire Aspect:
    - With Custom Enchantments installed, now applies Fire to all enemies hit by a sweep attack.
    - Duration is fixed to do 4 damage rather than do 4 seconds, rather than only 3 damage thanks to the first invulnerability tick. (At level 1)

  - Frostbite:
    - No longer applies Slowness. Applies -10% Speed (per level) for 4 seconds instead.
  
  Developer Commentary: Reducing the potency of effective CC options ensures players aren't able to make crowds a non-threat.

  - Frost:
    - No longer applies Slowness. Applies -20% Speed for 4 seconds instead.

  Developer Commentary: Reducing the potency of effective CC options ensures players aren't able to make crowds a non-threat.

  - Pin Down:
    - Duration of Exposed reduced to 4 seconds (from 5 seconds).
    - Changed vfx to 1.17 particles.
  
  - Point Blank:
    - Changed vfx to 1.17 particles.

  - Putrefy:
    - Duration of Infection reduced to 4 seconds (from 5 seconds).

  - Second Wind:
    - Now inflicts 6/12/18 true damage per tier, no longer inflicts normal damage.
    - Calculates fractions of damage properly. (Low mob damage, Poison and Wither will no longer bypass resistances.)

  Developer Commentary: Reducing the complexity of the enchant as well as adapting it to current limitations of CDL. Overall, the effect will be the same,
  as it will just execute the player if the player's health value is too far below the desired tier's amount (same as what it used to do).

Mimics:
  - You can now create a "Double Chest Mimic"
  - Double Chest Mimics act differently to normal mimics, and are stronger.

Custom Statuses:

  - Bleeding:
    - When above 5 Stacks (6 or more) Bleeding now does 33% of the mob's maximum health in damage per second.
    - Bleeding now inflicts 20% Weakness (aka -20% Attack Damage) on the mob, independent of the number of stacks.

  Developer Commentary: Bleeding has been the more lackluster of Cartographer's Custom Statuses. While originally intended to be something that was stacked
  via many hits to do high damage, it overall has struggled to fit this niche because repeated hits in Minecraft via a weapon often just kill the enemy, failing to
  justify Bleeding. These changes combined with the changes to Bleeding inflicting effects above will allow for the status to be a very offensively focused effect,
  keep it's original purpose, but improve it to be on par with other debuffs.

  - Exposed:
    - Reworked vfx and sfx with 1.17 particles and sounds.

  - Infection:
    - Infection no longer inflicts debuffs as mobs are damaged.
    - Infection inflicts -15% Speed and Attack Damage to mobs it spreads to (from other mobs)

  Developer Commentary: Infection is an incredibly powerful versatile status effect. The above change is made to simplify the effect while also reducing its power level.

  - Shocked:
    - Chance to either mini-stun or group knockback reduced to 15% for each event. (30% chance of an event) [Previously was 20% for each, 40% combined]
    - Reworked sfx and vfx with 1.17 particles. It is now more clear when a mini-stun/knockback event occurs via v/sfx feedback.

  Developer Commentary: Reducing the potency of effective CC options ensures players aren't able to make crowds a non-threat.

  - Stunned:
    - A mob is now stunned for less time proportional to their Knockback Resistance.
      - 5% Knockback Resistance grants the mob an innate 5% Stun Duration Reduction.
        - E.g. A mob with 50% Knockback Resistance that is stunned for 1 second will only be stunned for 0.5 seconds.

  Developer Commentary: Provides a natural born counter to Stunning effects that can be built in on mobs that already exist to be more "unstoppable".

Mob Abilities:

- General: All Mob Abilities that formerly did flat damage now do a percentage of the mob's "Attack Damage" attribute.
  - Any changes below unless specified otherwise of the format [Damage changed to X%] refer to "X% of the Attack Damage attribute"
  - Most values have been balanced around an average damage amount of 4. (Meaning abilities will do approximately the same damage they used to do when the mob has 4 attack damage)

- Active Abilities:
  - Augmenter:
    - Non on-hit traits (e.g Carapace, Predator, Aftershock, Volatile, Evocative) are applied to all affected mobs when cast.

  - Charge:
    - Damage changed to 250%.
  
  - Fireball:
    - Removed as behavior is similar to Magic Missile variations with traits (as well as new passives).

  - Disarm:
    - Damage changed to 50%.

  - Healer:
    - Limited to the closest 3 mobs.
    - Now heals 30% of the mob's maximum health (rather than a flat 8)
    - Non on-hit traits are applied to all affected mobs when cast.

  - Hookshot:
    - Damage changed to 50%.
    - Partially Reworked:
       - Reverted to hitscan attack.
       - No longer quickly drags the player to the mob.
       - Over the next 5 seconds, the victim is slowly dragged towards the attacking mob.
       - Attacking mob moves at 50% speed while "reeling in" the target.
       - When the attacking mob hurts the player (at close range) or after 5 seconds, the hook reeling ends.
       - When hookshot connects with a player, the cooldown is extended by 4 seconds.
  
  Developer Commentary: Hookshot being reworked for performance issues and also to make the ability feel more smooth.

  - Laser:
    - Attack Damage of the mob now changes the explosion size.
    - Every 12 damage increases the explosion size by 1 (up to a size of 4, starting at 2).

  - Novas:
    - As mentioned above, nova subsets no longer exist.
    - Nova now deals damage (and only damage by default) in an AoE around it, marked by a particle zone.
      - All subsets of old novas can be accessed through the Trait system.
    - Damage changed to 200%.

  - Magic Missile:
    - Attack Damage of the mob now changes the projectile damage.
    - Every 8 attack damage increases the number of firework stars by 2 (aka +3 damage).
    - No longer creates damaging field around its landing site.
    - Missile can now be detonated by projectiles and attacks (it has 2 health)
      - Detonated (meaning it deals damage) not destroyed (meaning it does nothing).

  - Smash:
    - Damage changed to 200%.

  - Sweep:
    - Damage changed to 150%.
  
  - Trapper:
    - Angle is slightly increased for traps.
    - Mob now jumps back a slight bit when throwing.
    - Caltrop radius is now 1.75 blocks (was 1.5)
    - Caltrops are now 8 second duration.
    - Caltrop slow is dependent on the Attack Damage stat of the mob.
      - Every 4 damage is one additional potency of Slowness (starting at 2, maxing at 6)

  - Webshot:
    - Damage changed to 150%.

 - Passive Abilities:
  - Quiver:
    - Now randomly shoots arrows from a hopper placed in the offhand of the mob.
    - Applies to all mobs that can fire arrows.

Cartographer, June 2021 Patch - Wrath of the Podiatrist

This is the first in a set of optimization and clean up patches. The goal of these series of patches is to re-optimize many sections of the pack
(creating a more fluid and fresh experience, with less lag) address a couple balance issues, and patch some holes in each module.

Overall, this still means a couple new features, but also a *ton* of reworks. Reworks, reworks, and more reworks. Many things are getting reworked!

Despite reworks, the goal is to expand on what the pack offers while also minimizing the content it offers that is similar to something offered by Vanilla
or elsewhere in Cartographer.

As a side note, this is the final update for 1.16.5. Future versions of this datapack will be for 1.17. Critical issues will be fixed for the 1.16.5 version,
but the pack will not receive new features or minor bugfixes for 1.16.5.

And with that, let's get on with the updates!

Additions:

Core:
 - A new feature has been added to Core: The Lexica Cartographia
    - The Lexica is an in game holdable manual item. It serves as the new home for full and verbose descriptions of Cartographer effects.
    - There is a placeable variant via a structure block structure.
    - Lexica entries only show up if you've discovered them (like Advancements)
    - Advancement and Tellraw entries have been shortened and simplified drastically.
      - Overall, they should still provide a basic understanding of the enchantment, but have less complex details and simplify understanding.

 - All entity hit detection in the entire pack has been moved to Gibbsly's Entity Hit Detection and ID system.
 - A slightly modified version of Gibbsly's system is now included as a separate "Core" datapack. This must now be installed in order for Cartographer to work.
    - This is labeled as "Cartographer - Core - Entity Hit Detection". Install this datapack with everything else in Cartographer.
      - Functionality wise, this is identical to Gibbsly's EHID system. If you are already using it for some other system, you do not need to install this datapack.
      - TLDR - If you have no idea what I am talking about and are not using Gibbsly's Custom Shields, install this datapack. :)

Custom Enchantments:
 - Thorns 2.0 is a custom enchantment in Cartographer which serves as an improvement to the vanilla Thorns enchant. [Custom Tag: {Thorns:1}]
    - Description: When attacked, deal damage back to the enemy equal to the level of Thorns you have.
    - Additionally, on hit melee enchants on items with Thorns will also apply their effects (like Fire Aspect)
    - Only if an item has both an on hit enchantment and Thorns will this apply (so Fire Aspect and Thorns on the same item)
    - No additional armor durability loss, or annoying chance based effects!

 - Loyalty 2.0 is a custom enchantment in Cartographer which serves as an improvement to the vanilla Loyalty enchantment. [Custom Tag: {Loyalty:1}]
    - Description: When thrown, this trident creates a "Prismarine Conch" in the slot it was occupying. When
    it lands, the trident will travel back to and return to your inventory, replacing the Conch when it reaches you.
    - Just like the vanilla version, higher levels of Loyalty increase the travel time.
    - Just like the vanilla version, hitting an enemy with the Loyalty trident makes it return faster.
    - Loyalty 2.0 times have been designed so that the approximate time to return is the same as vanilla Loyalty.
    - Loyalty 2.0 has a max level of 10.

 - Power and Punch have been brought to Crossbows with Custom Enchantments, with maximum levels of 10 and 5, respectively.
    - Simply apply the vanilla enchants to crossbows. No custom tags needed.

 - A couple new bow enchantments:
    - Putrefy: Inflicts the new Infection debuff in Custom Statuses (see below) for 5 seconds. [Custom Tag: {Putrefy:1}]
    - Flash: Inflicts Stunned on the hit target. [Custom Tag: {Flash:1}]
      - Stun duration and chance to stun are dependent on how charged the arrow shot is.
      - Maxes at 1 second and 70% chance, respectively.
 
 - A new passive enchantment:
    - Rally: When you are attacked by a mob, you can restore a portion of the health you lost by attacking quickly.
        Description: When attacked, a percentage of the damage the holder/wearer took can be restored by attacks they make in the next 2.5 seconds.
        During those 2.5 seconds, you deal 25% more melee damage and attack 25% faster.
        Initially, 15% of the damage you took can be restored, with each additional level up to 4 increasing the percentage by 10%,
        and each additional level after that increasing the percentage by 5%. (Max of 75%)

 - And a new curse enchantment (this has been in the code for a while but not fully implemented or finished):
    - Curse of Regret: Using the item inflicts 2 damage per level of Curse of Regret. (Maximum level is 5) [Custom Tag: {CurseRegret:1}]
      - Damage is negated by all sources of damage resistance.
 
Custom Statuses:
 - New Effect: Infection
    - Deals 2 damage per second to the afflicted mob.
    - Affected mob is affected by a percent loss of movement speed and melee damage based on how close to death they are.
      - The closer to death, the more debilitating the effect.
    - When an Infected mob dies, it spreads the effect (with it's remaining duration) to 2 nearby targets (not Infected, within 6 blocks).
    - If it cannot spread the effect, it deals 6 damage in a small AoE instead.
      - AoE is half the radius of the spread distance. (3 Blocks)
 
 - New (Player Only) Effect: Cleansing
    - Set to Nasuea 101 (Amplifier:100b)
    - Cleanses negative effects from players who obtain it.

 - All Status effects can be inflicted now via vanilla potions with custom Nausea effects.
    #Custom Debuff Conversion Chart
      # Nausea 10 - Stunned
      # Nausea 11 - Shocked
      # Nausea 12 - Infection
      # Nausea 13 - Bleeding
      # Nausea 14 - Bleeding II (Adds 2 Stacks of Bleeding)
      # Nausea 15 - Bleeding III (Adds 3 Stacks of Bleeding)
      # Nausea 16 - Bleeding IV (Adds 4 Stacks of Bleeding)
      # Nausea 17 - Bleeding V (Adds 5 Stacks of Bleeding)
      # Nausea 18 - Cloaked

  - Inflict the above Nausea level with the duration of time you want, and the custom effect will be applied to the mob (and Nausea removed).

  - Note: Bleeding stacks are added with proper math. If you apply Bleeding II to a mob with 2 Bleeding stacks, they will add up to Bleeding IV (4 stacks)
    - Bleeding cannot exceed a time of 10 seconds at any stack value. Doing so will cause unintended behavior.

Repair Stations:
  - The Station now has a new utility, known as the Limitless Tesseract.
    - If you break an item (run its durability out) it will be transported to the Limitless Tesseract.
    - Items you break can be repurchased from the tesseract for a minor material cost.
      - They will be in identical form to when they broke.
    - Each player's has their own storage in the Limitless Tesseract (like an Ender Chest).

Changes:

- Core now overwrites every vanilla mob loot table in the game for death detection systems.
  - You will nowhave to extend this to custom loot tables if you want death effects (abilities and Infection) to work on enemies.
  - You will now have to modify *these* loot tables if you want to edit the vanilla mob drops in the map.
  - More details can be found on the wiki's Core page.
  - It overall is a bit more of a hassle, but this will save on some performance, and allow enemies with death effects to drop their items.

Custom Enchantments:

 - Spectral Arrows now work with all Cartographer Bow and Crossbow enchantments.

 - Armor items with passive enchantments will no longer apply those passive enchantments in your main or offhand.

    Developer Commentary: This is a change to stop using an item intended to be worn providing effects in a slot it should not provide bonuses in.

 - The following enchantments now apply to Trident projectiles as if they were melee attacks.
    - Duelist
    - Hunter
    - Fire Aspect
    - Frostbite
    - Committed
    - Stunning
    - Vicious
    - Overload
    - Decay

  Developer Commentary: In order to make Duelist and Hunter more consistent with Smite and Bane of Arthropods, they now deal their increased damage on ranged attacks.
  To extend the general usefulness and item space for trident design, the above melee on hit effects will also work on ranged attacks.

 - Adrenaline, Energetic, and Frenzy have all received a scaling tweak.
    - Each level increases your move speed, mining speed, or attack damage by 20% per level.
    - The effect duration lasts 10 seconds, and each second the effect decreases in potency by 2% (per level).
    - TLDR: Higher levels of the enchants give a bigger potency, but in a burst that decays at a higher rate.
    - Time buffed is constant at all levels.
    - Revamped sfx and vfx for all 3 enchantments.

  Developer Commentary: While v2 of the scaling was better than v1, it left a lot to be desired where now higher levels of the enchant felt progressively less useful.
  v3 of the scaling attempts to solve this problem, by allowing a potency increase (shudder) but capping the duration at 10 seconds, and increasing how fast the buff
  drains over time. Hopefully, this will be the last scaling rework.

 - Auto Charge and Repeating:
    - Auto Charge will now trigger on Repeating Crossbows, reloading 1 Ammo per activation.
    - Repeating will now work with Spectral and Tipped Arrows.
      - Tipped Arrows *always* have priority on additional shot. Spectral comes next, then normals.
      - First arrow follows conventional vanilla priority (arrow in "lowest" inventory slot)
      - Auto Charge reload will load a copy of the ca.current "next shot" (so if your next shot will be a Poison Arrow, Auto Charge will copy the Poison Arrow instead)
      - All new effects work with Multishot

 - Committed:
    - Duration increased to 4 seconds (from 3) to be consistent with other effects that inflict constant time potency debuffs. (Frostbite)

 - Curse of Encumbering:
    - Trueshot arrows lose damage bonus from Point Blank 50% slower.

 - Curse of Shattering:
    - Now takes 50% of the item's remaining durability, rather than reducing it to 1 durability.

  Developer Commentary: Removing from remaining durability serves as a less punishing effect that doesn't necessarily force a player into immediate downtime, but will still punish
  a player more for dying while holding the item.

 - Decay:
    - Now uses the Custom Status "Infection" instead of Wither.
    - Inflicts 3/5/7 seconds of Infection, based on level.

  Developer: The introduction of Infection is to move Decay away from Wither. Wither in the past acted like a "different flavor" of Fire Aspect. In an effort to
  make the enchant more useful and unique, it has been given an entirely custom effect.

 - Deadeye:
    - Now inflicts on hit ranged enchantments (currently not including Punch).
    - Improved vfx and sfx.
    - Multishot now turns this effect into an un-aimed shotgun burst with reduced range.
    - Trueshot now increases the range of Deadeye projectiles.
    - Curse of Encumbering now decreases the range of Deadeye projectiles.

 - Eruption:
    - Knockback is now counted as an "on hit melee" enchantment.

  Developer Commentary: With the introduction of Thorns 2.0 and counting Knockback as one of its effects, it made sense to retroactively also include it on Eruption.

 - Evocation:
    - Reworked!
      - Evocation: "Special Attacks" (Sprint, Crits, and Sneak Attacks) with this weapon create Evoker Fangs.
      - Fangs are created at the cost of -70/-50/-30% Attack Speed for your next hit.
      - On hit effects (such as Fire Aspect) are applied to the fangs.
        - As an extra mention, this does work with Knockback. Fangs will apply vertical momentum instead of horizontal momentum.
      - Pattern of the fangs is dependent on the special attack used.
      - Cannot be used below 50% attack timer.
      - Fangs from Evocation are killed if the player walks over them.

  Developer Commentary: Evocation sat in a position where it wasn't too useful in a fight, and could still hurt the user. Since the effect only triggered on a mob's death,
  the effect only saved you time in cleaning up an already finished fight. This new rework offers it as a powerful "super attack" on the weapon, at the cost of some recharge
  speed. It has also received the on hit synergy treatment, to open up more potential combos.

 - Evasion:
    - Individual dodge chance per level decreased to 4% (from 5%).
    - Increased level cap to 20 (from 10). [Now a total of 80% attainable dodge chance]
    - Can now trigger in succession.
    - No longer triggers off non-mob attacks. [This may be reverted]
    - Pity math slightly nerfed to compensate higher stackability. (Maxes at 20% additional chance instead of 30% additional chance.)

  Developer Commentary: Evasion is an interesting enchant that in its previous scaling, was poised to be a "core" defense enchantment, but didn't scale the same as Protection.
  The above changes are to modify the scaling so that it has effectively the exact same scaling as Protection. While still offering its own other upsides, this will help Evasion
  and Protection levels feel more "equal" in worth. (And mathematically, a full 20 levels of Evasion will equal a full 20 levels of protection, either negating 80% of attacks,
  or 80% of the damage from attacks)

 - Executioner:
    - Threshold is now 10% per level (rather than 10% for first level, and 7.5% for second and third levels)

 - Hydraulic:
    - Tempest now increases the damage of Hydraulic shoves.
    - Drastically improved vfx.

 - Lifesteal:
    - Now stacks up to level 10.
    - Levels past 5 heal 1 additional health per 1.25 seconds. (via Regeneration II)

  Developer Commentary: To allow increasing of the Lifesteal cap to a more reasonable and easy to expect number, higher levels of Lifesteal provide over time
  healing rather than burst healing.

 - Regeneration:
    - Initial Value of the 1st level reduced to 1 health per 4 seconds (was 1 per 3 seconds).
    - Additional levels now reduce the time by 0.33 seconds (was 0.4 seconds).
    - Max level is now 10 (was 6).
  
  Developer Commentary: Regeneration is quite a powerful effect and was quite easy to stack quickly. The effect has now been spread out over a higher level cap, meaning
  an overall nerf to the enchantment. Approximately, 2 levels of Regeneration equal 1 level of old Regeneration with the new scaling. In terms of how it scales to the
  vanilla effect, Regeneration I (enchantment) is about twice as slow as Regeneration I (potion effect) and Regeneration II (potion effect) is about the same speed as
  Regeneration X (enchantment). This will allow Regeneration to serve as a more proper defensive enchantment without the threat of reaching the level cap quickly.

 - Ricochet:
    - No longer creates a projectile, instantly targets nearby entities instead.
    - Tempest now increases the damage of Ricochet bounces.

 - Sapper:
    - Now stacks up to level 10.
    - Levels past 5 heal 1 additional health per 1.25 seconds. (via Regeneration II)
    - If a Sapper pickaxe has Adrenaline, Frenzy, or Energetic, those enchantments will activate when you break a spawner.
      - Like Thorns 2.0, the pickaxe must have the enchantment.

  Developer Commentary: With synergies being added across the board, they are also being added to Sapper to allow more diverse item creation.
  To allow increasing of the Sapper cap to a more reasonable and easy to expect number, higher levels of Sapper provide over time
  healing rather than burst healing.

 - Satiation:
    - Reworked: Now provides 15 seconds of Absorption (with potency equal to your level) whenever you eat food (or drink a potion).
    - Additionally, provides 5 seconds of Resistance 1 when you eat food.
    - New level cap is 3 (from 6).
    - Not a feature, but worth noting this can be applied to and works on the actual food item itself.

  Developer Commentary: Satiation prior to this acted as a "different flavor of Lifesteal" that was potentially more powerful, but more frustrating to use than Lifesteal.
  In an effort to make effects more unique, the enchant has been turned into a new effect which allows one to use consumables more readily in combat. It can also be applied
  to the food items themselves, allowing you to create food that provides Absorption/Resistance.

 - Second Wind:
    - Revamped vfx and sfx. They're cleaner now, but about the same amount of pressure applying as they used to be.
    
    - Reworked background fatal hit detection system. Guaranteed to protect any fatal damage.
      - I don't mean this in jest. The system is 100% fool-proof when it comes to preventing lethals.
    - Second Wind no longer requires Evasion.
    - Second Wind will protect from any kind of lethal damage, including one-shot-kills.
    - Second Wind will not provide fatal protection while you have Absorption Health.

    - Second Wind's tiering system has been updated.
      - The first trigger (Tier 1) provides 12 Absorption Health for 10 seconds (Penalty Damage is 15).
      - The second trigger (Tier 2) provides 8 Absorption Health for 7 seconds (Penalty Damage is 30).
      - Third and further triggers (Tier 3) provide 4 Absorption Health for 4 seconds (Penalty Damage is 45).
        - All penalty damage is 20% "true damage" (damage that cannot be blocked by armor or enchantments) [3/6/9 respectively]
      - No longer inflicts debuffs on the player when it triggers.
  
    - New Descriptions:
      "While you have no Absorption Health, you will be protected from a lethal attack, cleansing all potion effects.
      When you are, your fatal hit protection is removed, and you receive a "Fatal Shield", which lasts for at most 10 seconds.

      While you have this Fatal Shield, killing a mob will restore health equal to the remaining value of the shield and restore
      your fatal hit protection (cleansing the shield). If the Fatal Shield runs out, either by being damaged or running out of time,
      the player is instead dealt a heavy instance of damage, 20% of which is "true damage".

      Successive triggers of Second Wind reduce the starting shield value by 4 (minimum of 4),
      reduce the starting duration by 3 seconds (minimum of 4), and increase the damage dealt by 15."
    
    - Short Read Description:
      "While you have no Absorption Health, you will be protected from a lethal attack.
      When you are, you gain a temporary shield, which when you slay a mob, restores your health.
      Failing to slay a mob before the shield runs out has drastic consequences.
      The effect can trigger in succession, but is less effective when it does."

 - Surging Strike:
    - Now deals 50/66/75% of the attack's base damage rather than 2/4/6 flat damage. (Equivalent to Sweeping Edge)
    - Now triggers on mobs up to 4 blocks away without the sprint attack. Sprint attack still allows hitting mobs up to 7 blocks away.
    - Knockback reduced by 50%.
    - On hit effect enchantments apply to enemies hit by the thrust attack.

  Developer Commentary: Scaling adjusted to work with Sweeping Edge so these two parallel effects are consistent. Additionally, it has been given an additional "grace"
  trigger, and can be activated without sprint hits (but the maximum value is still with sprint hits). As compensation for the easier to use trigger and potential higher damage
  on larger scaling weapons, its ca.knockback has been reduced.

 - Splintering:
    - Now deals 3 damage to all hit mobs.
    - Stun duration reduced to 2 seconds (from 3).

  Developer Commentary: Damage has been added to Splintering to make it feel more impactful in use. Stun duration has been reduced in an effort to reduce the amount of potent hard
  CC effects players can use on mobs.

 - Soulbound:
    - Now protects the item when you die from anything that would destroy it.

 - Tempo Theft:
    - No longer provies Haste at any level.
    - Reworked effect: Steal 15% Movement Speed from an attacked mob for 10 seconds per level.
      - Steal applies a slowing effect to the mob equivalent to the speed you temporarily gain.

  Developer Commentary: This was always intended to be the ideal version of Tempo Theft (i.e. the exact effect from Minecraft Dungeons) but 1.15.2 did not have the attribute command.
  The effect has been reworked to use the attribute command, adding the speed stealing bonus. The haste has been removed and the speed tuned to compensate for an on demand potent
  slowing ranged attack.

 - Transfiguration:
    - Now a 5% chance per level to create a "Poultrygheist". Poultrygheists cannot drop feathers, but they can drop extra amounts of "Suspicious Meat"
    - Once it creates a Poultrygheist, the enchantment is placed on a 15 second internal cooldown.
    - Now features bias against expectation in random mechanics.
    - Now affects all enemies hit by the sweep attack (rather than 1).
    - Still cannot affect enemies with the "elite" or "boss" tag.
    - Reworked sfx and vfx.

  Developer Commentary: Transfiguration was a bit of a novelty enchantment. It was too low of a chance to actively be useful except at maximum level. The new version
  prevents it from being used to farm materials as easily, but allows it to trigger more commonly in exchange for an internal cooldown so it can't trigger too often.
  Suspicious Meat has Curse of Vanishing to limit the effectiveness of farming it. The drop is affected by Looting, so it can be a nice source of early game food.

 - Trueshot:
    - Trueshot arrows are affected twice as much by Sharpshot.
    - Trueshot arrows lose damage bonus from Point Blank 50% faster.

 - Two Handed:
    - Item is now a "Compressed Item" not in a Knapsack. Can no longer be placed.
    - Compressed Items in your inventory or offhand when not holding a Two Handed item are automatically uncompressed.
    - An item takes 1 second to uncompress after you stop holding a Two Handed item.
    - Compressed items now have a small speed penalty and kbr bonus when in your offhand.
      - Clarification: Debuff is only active while item is compressed. Uncompressing removes the debuff from the item.

  Developer Commentary: Two Handed no longer has Knapsack functionality as it was the source of many unfixable duplication bugs. As compensation, Compressed Items
  are even smoother, and auto uncompress in your inventory. Your offhand item takes a bit longer to uncompress in order to increase the impact of the Two Handed enchant
  mid combat, ensuring the effects are felt more in general, and not rarely when you use the item. Compressed items apply a small speed debuff and kbr buff to accent this.
  Ideally this debuff is not enough to make a Two Handed item unusable with a compressed item in your offhand (as part of the big draw is making it so players are not
  encouraged to not fill their offhand slot) but make the curse feel a bit more "curse like". Please let me know how this feels, I welcome feedback on it.
 
 - Volatile:
    - Level cap reduced to 1 (from 3).
    - Firework now deals damage equivalent to the damage the arrow deals. (Approximately)
    - Volatile explosions now also inflict on hit ranged enchantments (like Flame) to enemies caught within the blast.
    - Volatile arrows should create explosions even if they kill their targets.
    - Volatile arrows no longer create explosions when they hit blocks.

  Developer Commentary: Volatile has lost level scaling in exchange for scaling with the direct power of the arrow. Additionally, it now serves as the Bow/Crossbow's
  propogation effect, allowing splash debuffs of custom enchantment effects. Explosions have been removed from block hits to make the enchant consistent with other
  Bow effects, and because it was causing performance issues.

Custom Statuses:

 - Shocked:
    - Chance of knock back when damage tick received reduced to 20% (from 100%)
    - Chance of "mini stun" when damage tick received increased to 20% (from 0%)
    - (Mini stun and knock back are mutually exclusive events. Only one can activate per tick)
    - RNG pity system implemented to make chance more consistent.

  Developer Commentary: Proper uses of past Shocked could easily prevent hordes of enemies from ever getting close to the player. In an effort to reduce this effect,
  the chance of Knockback has been reduced severely. As a side grade, Shocked can now mini stun the crowd, which will slow them down briefly, but also cancel any
  active attacks or abilities. As with Evasion, a pity system has been built in to help ensure you get at least one activation out of the CC.

 - Vulnerability:
    - Is now called "Exposed" since the mechanic works and functions differently from Resistance (and thus should follow a more unique naming scheme)
    - Can be stacked up to 10.
    - Improved vfx
    - Sfx and vfx when an Exposed mob takes damage.

Mimics:

  Mimic:
    - Projectile Damage Resistance reduced from 64% to 48%.
    - Health ca.regeneration while enraged reduced to 4 (from 6) (every 5 seconds).
    - Mimics gain 20% Knockback Resistance while enraged.
    - Mimics now drop a chest ("Mimic Carcass") that is an exact copy of the chest they were posing as.
      - They still drop XP and Mimic Heads.
      - Like with before, the behavior works with both manually filled mimic chests and loot table set mimic chests.

    - The Mimic bossbar can now be seen from 64 blocks away (was 20)

Mob Abilities:

 - General:
    - Abilities that immobilize or root a mob no longer use Slowness and Weakness effects. They now use custom attributes instead.
    - Abilities have either been reformatted to use the movement and damage disable effects, or movement and damage reduction effects.
    - Movement and Damage reduction reduces a mob's damage and movement speed by 50%.
    - Some abilities can now make mobs temporarily ca.knockback immune.
    - All Cooldowns are reduced by 20-25% on Hard (and higher) difficulty.

 - Token System:
    - Cartographer's token system (that's such an ugly phrase, we need a better one...) erm... the **Mob Manager** has been entirely reworked!

 - Mob Manager:
    - Difficulty control is far more noticeable. Easy is noticeably easier, Hard is noticeably harder.
    - Hordes of enemies get more frequent and aggressive as the difficulty increases.
    - More enemies can attack in higher bursts on higher difficulties, and they can do this more often.
    - Difficulty settings for independent difficulty above Hard still exist.
    - Attacks have been split into "Light" and "Heavy" attacks.
      - Less Heavy attacks can be used in succession by groups of mobs than light attacks, and less frequently.

    - Light Attacks: Ambush, Charge, Disarm, Fireball, all Novas, Smash, Sweep, Trapper, Webshot
    - Heavy Attacks: Augmenter, Cloaker, Duplicator, Healer, Hookshot, Laser, Magic Missile, Wither Storm
      - These presets can be overwritten for individual mobs with the "heavy_priority" and "light_priority" tags.

Active Abilities (now called "Active Skills" in Lexica):
 - Ambush:
    - Charge time reduced to 1 second (from 2).
    - Mob is immobilized and unable to damage players for 0.75 seconds after teleporting (was 1 second).
    - Mob damage and speed is reduced for 1.5 seconds after teleporting (was 0 seconds).

  Developer Commentary: In order to make Mob Abilities slightly more fast paced, many Mob Ability charge up timers are being modified.
  In light of this, Ambush activates twice as fast, but the mob is debuffed for the duration and slightly after the attack, meaning
  that ambush attacks will not be as detrimental with the reduced charge time.

 - Augmenter:
    - Now reduces the speed and damage of the caster rather than immobilizing them (see above)
    - Augmenter can no longer apply the augmentation buff to nearby Augmenter mobs.

 - Charge:
    - Charge now breaks blocks at the end of the cast (to prevent the mob from getting stuck in walls)
    - Charge uses better tracking to help prevent mobs from becoming stuck in walls.
    - Vfx adjusted.

 - Cloaker:
    - Now reduces the speed and damage of the caster rather than immobilizing them (see above)
    - Augmenter can no longer cloak nearby Cloaker mobs.

 - Disarm:
    - Reworked!
      - The mob laughs and reduces in speed, damage, and becomes ca.knockback immune.
      - After 1 second, the mob attacks a small area in front of it. Players hit take 4 damage and are blinded for 1 second.
      - The mob will copy the player's mainhand item and place it into their main hand. (the player's item is not lost or manipulated)
      - The mob will lose Disarm and gain a different ability based on the item they copied.
        - Smash if it was an Axe.
        - Trapper if it was a ranged weapon (Bow, Crossbow, Trident)
        - Sweep for all other items.
        - Mob's cooldown is set to 1 second if the hit is successful (rather than the default 10 seconds).

  Developer Commentary: Disarm was one of the most infuriating and frustrating effects in the game, that was never engaging to fight.
  The new version copies the weapon the player uses, and replaces Disarm, so they only "take" one weapon. Overall, this dynamic ability
  will make combat more interesting than the old hard CC effect of dropping your important items.

 - Duplicator:
    - Charge time reduced to 1 second (from 2).
    - Duplicator now works on every hostile mob.

    - Duplicator now reduces the speed and damage of the caster while charging.
    - Duplicated mobs always have half the ca.current Health of the original mob.
    - Duplicated mobs now have a lifetime of 18 seconds (was 15).

    - Duplicated mobs now copy *all* nbt from the original mob (besides the Duplicator tag)
      - *Unless* they have the "mitosis" tag in which Duplicates can copy themselves.
        - When copies can copy themselves, the newly created copies receive much lower cooldowns.

    - Duplicated mobs (not mitosis variant) explode on death, dealing 4 damage to everything within 2 blocks.
      - Explosion does not damage terrain.
      - Explosion affects players and hostile mobs.
      - Explosion does not trigger if duplicates despawn.

    - Duplicator by default only makes 1 mob copy.
      - Additional copies can be added via the "triple" (2 copies), "quadruple" (3 copies), and "quintuple" (4 copies) tags.

  Developer Commentary: While the effect hasn't gotten a rework, Duplicator has received an extensive number of changes to improve the effect and give
  more control to mapmakers using it. It also now copies all the nbt from the mob, meaning more terrifying enemies can be made with it. Duplicates now
  explode on death to further incentivize attacking the real one.

 - Fireball:
    - Charge time reduced to 1 second (was 2).
    - Projectile is now spawned above the mob rather than in front of it.

 - Flame, Frost, Soulfire, Venom, and Wind Nova:
    - Charge up time reduced to 3 seconds (was 4).
    - Now reduce the speed and damage of the caster rather than immobilizing them (see above)
    - Wind Nova specifically: Now creates a cloud of levitation on hit targets rather than inflicting levitation.
      - These clouds vanish when a player consumes them or after a couple seconds.

  Developer Commentary: As with above, to increase the aggression of some Cartographer Mob Abilities, charge up timers have been reduced across the board.

 - Healer:
    - Now reduces the speed and damage of the caster rather than immobilizing them (see above)
    - Healer can no longer heal nearby Healer mobs.

  Developer Commentary: Augmenter, Cloaker, and Healer no longer work on mobs with the same ability to avoid hordes of mobs with these effects
  from being very hard to kill.
    
 - Hookshot:
    - Damage increased to 4 (from 2).
    - Fixed the frankly absurd problems where this ability could drag players in all sorts of unintended paths.
    - Projectile can no longer travel through walls. (Its a hook, not a spirit tether from the aethervoid)

 - Magic Missile:
    - Projectile now has an actual homing effect rather than direct following snap to precision.
    - The speed of the projectile is now slower, and constant at all distances from the player.
    - Projectile now leaves behind a cloud of magic residue when it explodes, that inflicts 8 seconds of Wither II.

 - Smash:
    - Damage reduced to 8 (from 10).
    - Slowness effect removed from the attack.
    - Damage now triggers centered on the mob in a 3.5 block radius.
    - Mob will leap forwards and up in the direction they are facing.
    - Mob will leap higher in vertical mobility.
    - Mob will cast the damage effect when they actually land rather than 1 second into the future.
    - Vfx adjusted.

    - The tags "recast" and "rerecast" can be used to make a Smash mob attack with multiple smashes in succession (2 or 3).

  Developer Commentary: One of the biggest focuses of Mob Abilities this patch is removing unnecessary CC effects from abilities where it
  thematically makes little sense to have them. Additionally, the way Smash works has been reworked so that the attacked area can be made much
  more clear to players, and to increase the aggressiveness of the ability.

 - Sweep:
    - Damage reduced to 6 (was 8).
    - Weakness effect removed from the attack.
    - Attack shape and size reworked. Is now a very narrow cone that reaches out up to 4 blocks away from the caster. (Max size is 3.2 blocks, min size is 2.2 blocks)
    - Charge up time reduced to 0.5 seconds (was 1).
    - Sweep now moves the mob forward 1.5 blocks after the attack is made (in the direction of the attack)

    - The tags "recast" and "rerecast" can be used to make a Sweep mob attack with multiple sweeps in succession (2 or 3).
    - The tag "mobile" makes the mob move a bit farther (2 blocks instead of 1.5)
    - The tag "unstoppable" makes the mob not attempt to realign with the player on recasts.


  Developer Commentary: As above with Smash, removing unnecessary CC effects from abilities was a part of the core updates to Mob Abilities.
  Thus, Sweep's focus has been reworked to be a fast acting melee attack.

 - Trapper:
    - Reworked vfx, traps are now called "enchanted caltrops" in the death message.
    - Charge time reduced to 1 second (was 2).

 - Wither Storm:
    - Values have been entirely reworked.
    - Effect is the same, but overall, more consistency.
    - Fixed bug where projectiles would not be placed properly.
    - A projectile is guaranteed to be placed above the player's position when the storm starts.

Death Effects (now called "Morbid Skills" in the Lexica):
  - Brutal Blood:
    - Now stacks up to 10 stacks.
    - Each stack now increases melee damge by 10% rather than a flat +1.
  
  - Relentless Blood:
    - Now stacks up to 10 stacks.
    - Each stack now only provides 5% speed (was 10%).

  - Devious Blood:
    - Now grants Devious Stacks instead of resetting cooldowns.
      - Devious Stacks grant 30% Cooldown Reduction to mobs that have active skills. (Max of 10, at 300% Cooldown Reduction [4 times as fast])
    - Enemies that do not have actives are given a Relentless Stack instead.

  - Sacrificial Blood:
    - Now grants Sacrificial Stacks instead of Absorption Health.
      - Sacrificial Stacks grant 1 Absorption Health per stack whenever they are increased. (Max of 10, gaining 10 Absorption Health whenever Sacrificial Blood stacks are increased)
    - Sacrifical Stacks cannot be applied to Sacrifical Blood mobs. They are instead given Brutal Blood stacks.
  
    Developer Commentary: All blood effects now stack to 10 rather than their previous stack counters or other effects, to make them more in line
    with each other. Additionally, Relentless speed values have been reduced to make the ramping of speed less drastic, and Brutal stacks now use percentage
    damage to prevent enemies like Silverfish and Cave Spiders from becoming monsters with stacks. Devious and Sacrificial Blood now use stack systems instead
    of instant constant value buffs, to reduce their power level.

  - Corpse Crawler:
    - All corpse crawler variants will drop eggs which hatch into the enemies, instead of spawning the enemies immediately.
      - Hatch time is 2 seconds.
      - Eggs can be destroyed before they hatch to prevent the enemy from spawning.
        - Eggs have 5 health.
    - Corpse Crawler now has a 50% chance to spawn an additional 4th egg, and a 75% chance to spawn the third egg.
    - Corpse Crawler now has a subtype for cave spiders ("corpse_crawler_spider")
    - Corpse Crawler mob stats have been retuned. Arthropods have less health and damage, Zoglins have less damage, more health. Undead are unchanged.

    Developer Commentary: Corpse Crawler is a death effect that activates immediately when the mob dies, with little to no counterplay.
    The above changes add some much needed counterplay and overall nerf the ability slightly, while keeping the feel and idea of the
    ability.

  - Exalted:
    - Reworked!
      - When the mob dies, it drops a soul near its position and leaves its weapon at it's death pile.
      - The mob's soul will be placed about 12 blocks away from the mob. It will move towards the nearest weapon to "reclaim" it.
      - If the soul manages to reclaim the weapon (stands on the weapon for 4 seconds) the entity will be respawned in its default spawn state.

    Developer Commentary: Inspired by the Hades enemy type of similar name, this new effect will serve as an interesting way to allow respawning enemies.
    The old effects of Exalted have been bundled into Spectral changes (see below).

  - Parting Gift:
    - TNT fuse time increased to 5 seconds (was 4).

    Developer Commentary: This slightly longer extra time will help players escape from Parting Gift when it is dropped.

  - Pyromania:
    - Pyromania now creates a "magma shulker" when the enemy dies.
    - The magma shulker releases heat around it for 2.5 seconds, creating fire and magma around it.
    - When finished, it drops a full lava source at its position.
      - The shulker can be destroyed by placing a block inside its space.

    Developer Commentary: In line with the Corpse Crawler changes, Pyromania's changes are to help players combat death effects before they trigger.
    Thus, the effect now has a lengthier warmup to finishing the effect, and it can be canceled in the same way lava from Pyromania could be removed
    previously. The ability is slightly more destructive to compensate for these changes (with Magma blocks and Fire).

  - Spectral:
    - Now spawns 1 of three different types of Spectres.
      - The Standard Ambushing Shade (the ca.current existing one)
      - The Ranged Trapping Poltergeist (Pillager type mob)
      - The Tanky Charging Revenant (Wither Skeleton type mob)
    - All Spectres spawn with reduced movement and damage for 2 seconds.

    Developer Commentary: Spectral now provides enemy variety to keep the effect more interesting. Spectres are also weakened when they first spawn to prevent
    unfair attacking from the Spectre.

Passive Effects:
  - Reflect:
    - The mob will now always counter attacks of the correct type, regardless of range attacked at.
      - This means melee attacks hitting Reflect Melee mobs will always reflect, and ranged attacks hitting Reflect Ranged mobs will always reflect.
      - Mobs will no longer enter a "reflective stance" depending on the range of players.
    - Damage reflected is now 50% of the damage dealt to the mob (was a flat 4)
    - Mob is immediately healed for 50% of the damage dealt (instead of 80% damage reduction)
    - Mob is stunned for 0.5 seconds after reflecting.
    - Mob has their movement speed and damage reduced by 50% for 2 seconds after reflecting (instead of slower movement and ca.knockback resistance in a reflective stance).
    - Mob is always equipped with a Reflector Mirror Shield to indicate the effect (in offhand). The shield is cosmetic.
    - Reworked vfx and sfx

    Developer Commentary: Reflect has moved over to using the Entity Hit Detection System from Gibbs. This brought an opportunity to change how it works without
    costs in performance. In order to make the balance of all attacks more fair, Reflect now uses percentage based damage and recovery effects. Instead of blocking
    attacks based on proximity, it will now do as implied, and block attacks of a specific type. To counteract the fact that Reflect mobs are now always much faster,
    an actual reflection will halt the mob's progress considerably, meaning if you have the defensive capability, a Reflecting mob can be stunlocked.

Repair Stations:

  Station:
    - Station now creates an impassable entity wall to prevent more than one player from interacting with the station at a time.
    - Station will remove all other players from the zone that are not the nearest player (when station is activated)
    - Station now allows for flexible max levels and scaling.
    - Station will block a repair if the player attempting the repair doesn't have the needed materials.

Cartographer, Patch 2021.2.0 - Divine Additions

Alright lets start out with the announcements!

First, I am no longer considering Cartographer in open beta! Any beta versions of Cartographer will be marked accordingly on github.

There's a slight change to my naming format which might be a tad confusing, but the overall patch is going to go "Year.Month.Hotfix". So welcome to 2020.11.0!
Individual modules will be named with version counts (V1.0 / V1.1 etc). This is to hopefully avoid confusion with modules of "version 1.0" but a patch of a later date.

Cartographer is also updating to 1.16.5 and higher. Piglin Brutes have been added to all hostile tags necessary.
This means the datapack will no longer work in versions before 1.16.2. Sorry anyone who was using those versions!

We're moving up due to complications with security in 1.16.1. Additionally, the upcoming project I'm leading (more below) is going to be a 1.16.5 release!

Now onto the update itself.

This is an update to prepare Cartographer for use in an upcoming project I've been proud to help lead: Divinity's End.
As the first major map to use Cartographer, this is super exciting! A lot of these changes are being made with the balance
of that project in mind, but also to improve features across the board.

This doesn't mean no new content though. There are additions to Mob Abilities, Custom Statuses, and 2 new modules. (Repair Stations and Mimics)
And now lets get into the details!

Additions:

Repair Stations bring an alternative to anvils, for maps that do not want to include anvils, but still have repairable gear.
- Repair Stations can be summoned into the world with a structure block. See the wiki for more details.
- Repair Stations can only repair items with durability, and items that aren't fully repaired.
- Repair Stations will cost the user Experience Levels, Lapis Lazuli, and the material the item is made with.
- When you repair an item, its experience and lapis cost will double. (Material cost is constant)
- Items cannot be repaired over a cap. This cap is by default set to 50 Levels and 20 Lapis. If either is above the allowed threshold, the item is irreparable.
- Default starter repair cost of items with no stats is 12 Levels, 4 Lapis. This will probably change based on user feedback.

Mimics bring the stereotypical greedy player punisher to Minecraft. Warning, these Mimics aren't fooling around.
- Mimics appear as trapped chests, and are placeable via structure blocks.
- If a Mimic is opened, it will reveal itself, damaging the player for their foolishness, and stealing some of their hunger bar.
- Mimics can be broken in dormant state, or shot with an arrow. Doing so will reveal them, and do some free damage to them.
- When Mimics are threatened, they get angry. You won't like them when they're angry.
- You might be able to loot a Mimic if you're invisible, or if you have some disguise (while it is in the dormant state).
- Mapmakers can customize what loot mimics drop on death. Simply place the items in the chest in creative mode, or while the mimic is inactive.
- Mimics scale their stats based on the armor value of the player opening them. The stronger the player, the stronger the Mimic.

Core:
- Core now features a very heftily overhauled reload message.
  - Message now features buttons to configure various Cartographer options, see a list of credits, and access the wiki and download pages.
  - Every module in Cartographer with handbook advancements now features chat prompts which help draw attention to custom effects.
  - Both the reload message can be turned off (into a more minimal version) and so can handbook chat prompts.
  - Core now features player array data storage and manipulation, used across the board for enchants that affect the player's inventory.

- Core now features a robust multiplayer array player modification system, courtesy of Suso!
  This has been integrated into many player modifying effects to hopefully make them smoother.

Custom Enchantments:
- 2 (technically 3) New Enchantments to brawl with!
  - Executioner: When a mob is attacked by this *melee* weapon, if the attack would leave them below 10% of their health, they are immediately killed instead.
    - Additional Levels increase this threshold by 7.5%.
    - Max of 3 levels. (total of 25% threshold)
  - Vanquisher: Elite enemies attacked by this *melee* weapon take 2.5 more damage per level.
    - Max of 5 levels. (+12.5 damage)
    - any "elite" enemy is a hostile mob with the tag "elite"
  - Deadeye: This crossbow fires instant traveling bolts that auto lock on nearby enemies instead of arrows, doing 10 damage.
    - Single Level
    - This enchant has technically existed and worked for a while, but now it is "properly" introduced, and will have entries in Cartographer.

- New Option: Toggle Charge Info 
  - Changes the position of enchantment charge/ammo count information (for Echo and Repeating, see below).
  - Can be set to the actionbar, subtitle, or entirely invisible.
  - Set on a per player basis.

Mob Abilities:
- 3 new active abilities have been added: Cloaker
  - Cloaker works similarly to Healer and Augmenter. After a brief immobile delay, the mob with Cloaker will grant 12 seconds of "Cloaked" to nearby mobs.
  - What is Cloaked? Read more about it in Custom Statuses!
- Next up: Wind Nova
  - Very similar to existing nova attacks, but when hit, you are launched into the air instead!
  - No guaranteed fall protection. Better grab some feather falling!
- The other new ability is Wither Storm:
  - Wither Storm makes the mob blind and immobile while charging.
  - Has a delay, after which, wither skulls are rained down around players.
  - Very destructive!
  - While creating the skull rain, mob is unable to attack or move.

- 2 new passive abilities have been added: Permacloak
  - A permacloaked mob is permanently "Cloaked". (Cloak is re-applied every 5 seconds for 5 seconds.)
- The other is Enderport:
  - When an arrow or trident passes near the mob, it warps out of the way to safety.
  - It gains Speed 2 and Strength 1 for 8 seconds when it does, to catch back up to you!

- Finally, mobs with Resistance 5 will create "Invulnerable" pop-ups when attacked, as well as create unique sfx.


Custom Statuses:
- Added a new positive status effect for enemies: "Cloaked"
  - Cloaked makes a mob invisible until the timer runs out.
  - While Cloaked, the mob emits vibrant purple particles around its location.
  - While Cloaked, the mob emits strange ghostly sounds around it. The louder they are, the more cloaked enemies there are nearby.
  - While Cloaked, if the mob takes damage, the duration of Cloaked is reduced by 3 seconds.

- New Option: Independent Difficulty
  - When disabled, (default) Mob Abilities will use the world difficulty to set helper_diff on all players.
  - When enabled, Mob Abilities will ignore world difficulty, allowing a custom value between 1 and 5 to be set.

Changes:

Core:
- Helper Healing functions have been reworked to all use area effect clouds instead of Regeneration effect commands. This makes healing immediate rather than very slightly delayed.
- Helper clouds have received tweaks to ensure they are simultaneously more accurate, and don't have unintended behavior.
- Helper clouds now scale in powers of 2, rather than having a command for each value up to 8. This means any value of healing can be cast on the player by combining the right values.
- Helper clouds exist for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 healing.

- Helper mob damage now uses a score to deal the damage. Set "damage_queue" equal to the damage you want to deal, and then run the damage command.
- Helper mob damage now takes Absorption into account, and will damage Absorption health first.
- Helper mob damage now takes Resistance 5 into account, and will not do damage if the mob has it.

- Core has additional push functions for ca.knockback events of varying degrees. These are very complex and hard to use outside of Cartographer (you're welcome to try) at least for now.
- Used to apply ca.knockback to a couple new things at different amounts.
- Core now has a "projectile" tag. Currently contains arrows and tridents, and is used to help optimize some functions.

- Cartographer now uses Purple Shulker Boxes for its Shulker Box trick mechanics. This is to help prevent it from causing issues with other mechanics in maps made by other mappers.
  - This change is automatically made on reload. A user should not have to do anything.

Custom Enchantments:

- Adrenaline:
  - Scaling has been adjusted.
    - New scaling is 5 seconds for the first level, 5 seconds for the second level, and one less second per additional level of the enchant.
    - TLDR (5/10/14/17/19/20 seconds) per level.

- Auto Charge:
  - If an Auto Charge Crossbow is already loaded, it will look to load the next one in your hotbar or offhand.

- Current:
  - Instantly recharges your attack time instead of giving Haste 10 for 1 second (on return)
  - Current applies "Stunned" to mobs it is carrying.

- Deadeye:
  - Inflicts small amount of ca.knockback (its hidden version did not)

- Decay:
  - Now has particle effects for hits.

- Duelist:
  - Scaling is now equivalent to Smite and Bane of Arthropods.
  - This means each level provides +2.5 damage to Illager mobs. (2.5/5/7.5/10/12.5)

- Echo:
  - Reworked!
    - Per level, now stores charges of instant attacks.
    - When you hit a mob with an ca.echo weapon, decrease 1 charge.
    - While you have charges, your weapon recharges instantly, and you gain a small amount of ca.knockback resistance.
    - Gain charges back when out of combat.
    - Or gain 1 of them back when you kill a mob.
    - Each level of Echo gives +1 charge. Echo I starts at 2 charges (2/3/4 Echo attacks)
    - Echo charges can be seen in the subtitle space, actionbar space, or hidden entirely.

- Energetic:
  - Scaling has been adjusted.
    - New scaling is 5 seconds for the first level, 5 seconds for the second level, and one less second per additional level of the enchant.
    - TLDR (5/10/14/17/19/20 seconds) per level.

- Eruption:
  - Damage increased to 3 per level. (Scales 3/6/9/12/15)
  - Radius reduced to 8 (was 10).
  - Radius is now centered around the spawner.
  - Now inflicts a small amount of ca.knockback.
  - Now inflicts on hit enchantments when triggered (Fire Aspect, Frostbite, Decay, Overload, Vicious, Committed, Stunning). Thanks ShadowVisions for this suggestion!
  - Improved vfx

- Evasion:
  - When Evasion triggers, enemies within 8 blocks are blinded for 3 seconds.
  - When Evasion triggers, enemies within 8 blocks are knocked back a short distance.
  - Now features a "bias against expectation" system.
    - Each failed trigger of ca.evasion raises the chance of it triggering by 5%. (Capping at 30% additional chance)
    - When Evasion triggers, this counter is reset.
    - You only gain "Evasion Bias" when wearing Evasion gear.
    - This does not increase your Evasion level, it only increases the chance of Evasion successfully triggering over time.

- Evocation:
  - Reworked!
    - Per level, when you kill a mob, create rows of fangs at nearby mobs.
    - Each level creates 1 additional row of fangs at different nearby mobs. (Max of 3 rows of fangs)

- Frenzy:
  - Scaling has been adjusted.
    - New scaling is 5 seconds for the first level, 5 seconds for the second level, and one less second per additional level of the enchant.
    - TLDR (5/10/14/17/19/20 seconds) per level.

- Frostbite:
  - Slowness duration reduced to 4 seconds. (from 5)

- Hunter:
  - Scaling is now equivalent to Smite and Bane of Arthropods.
  - This means each level provides +2.5 damage to Monstrous mobs. (2.5/5/7.5/10/12.5)

- Infinity:
  - Has been recoded from the ground up behind the scenes. (Twice actually)
  - No effective change to the enchant, but hopefully less bugs and weird interactions.

- Lifesteal:
  - Creates sfx and vfx when it triggers.

- Point Blank:
  - Creates sfx and vfx when fired.

- Repeating:
  - No longer duplicates arrows. Consumes and loads only the exact amount of arrows you have in your inventory (or the max it can load)

- Regeneration:
  - Creates vfx when it triggers.

- Repeating:
  - Ammo can be seen in the subtitle space, actionbar space, or hidden entirely.

- Ricochet:
  - Creates actual projectiles which fan out from the base mob, hitting other mobs.
  - Projectiles deal 7 damage each.
  - Projectiles can target and hit the same enemy (and will if there are no other nearby enemies).

- Second Wind:
  - Deals 10 damage to the player. (instead of fireworks)
  - 2nd and 3rd triggers increase the damage by 5. (10/15/20..)
  - 4th and higher triggers do 30 damage. (10/15/20/30/30..)
  - Repeated triggers inflict debuffs. (No Debuff / Slowness I / Slowness I Mining Fatigue I / Slowness I Mining Fatigue I Weakness I...)
  - Second Wind no longer blinds nearby enemies when triggered. (The Evasion hit still does though.)
  - When an enemy is killed, and the user is out of absorption hearts, but have not been killed, the system will instead skip the damage event.
    - This is to prevent awkward interactions where you "killed" an enemy before death, but were still punished for it anyways.
  - Reworked vfx and sfx

- Sharpshot:
  - Creates sfx and vfx when fired.

- Two Handed:
  - Only affects the mainhand item, rather than the hotbar.
  - Item is unbundled when you are no longer holding the Two Handed weapon in your mainhand.
  - Two Handed items can no longer be placed in the offhand.

Developer Commentary:
Adrenaline, Energetic, and Frenzy have all received scaling adjustments to make lower levels feel much more useful.
Eruption damage has been buffed to make it feel more useful, with a slight nerf to its range, and the introduction of ca.knockback to make
its damage feel more normal.
Evasion has received multiple changes to help it feel more impactful.
Second Wind has been given harsher scaling, to prevent it from being powerful when combined with
high defense armor. Now the damage dealt by Second Wind's 4th tier should always execute the player
should they be under 6 health. (assuming unenchanted Diamond or Netherite gear)
Two Handed is intended as a curse effect that denies an inventory slot. In order to make it feel less detrimental, clunky, and restrictive,
it now only applies in your main hand. Additionally, it auto-unbundles items in your offhand when you stop holding it.

Mob Abilities:

Global Overall Changes:
- All mob abilities only work on hostile mobs. While this is a somewhat of a restrictive change, it is being done for performance reasons.
  - All mobs that can use mob abilities are controlled directly by Core's hostile mob tag.
  - You can modify this tag to extend abilities to other mobs, be warned that all Cartographer systems will count them as "hostile".

- The exception to this is Quiver, which now only works on skeleton variants (controlled by the minecraft:skeletons tag)
  - Pillagers and Piglins behave... weirdly with tipped arrows.
  - This is also to help with performance.
  - This will likely be unrestricted when Piglins and Pillagers properly interact with singular tipped arrows.

Augmenter:
  - Improved sfx and vfx.
  - Handbook description no longer incorrectly labels Augmenter buffs as level 1, and now properly labels them as level 2.
  - Augmenter now places Slowness 7 on the mob while charging. (ground based mobs cannot move)

Breaker:
  - No longer breaks spawners.
  - Reworked sfx.

Charge:
  - Uses player location to aim instead of direct forward motion.
  - Deals 10 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Corpse Crawler:
  - Has variants for zombies, husks, drowned, piglins, zoglins, and bees.

Disarm:
  - Deals 7 damage (instead of using fireworks).

Duplicator:
  - Now works on Piglins, Pillagers, Creepers, Spiders, and Cave Spiders.

Flame Nova:
  - Deals 8 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Frost Nova:
  - Deals 8 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Healer:
  - Improved sfx and vfx.
  - Places Slowness 7 on the mob while charging. (ground based mobs cannot move)

Hookshot:
  - Deals 2 damage. (Instead of fireworks)
  - Recoded. Now acts as a projectile.
  - Projectile instantly retracts when it fails to catch a player.
  - When the projectile catches a player, after a brief delay, they are dragged back towards the caster.

Laser:
  - Tracks player location using an armor stand rather than look direction.
  - Laser is more accurate on non-bipedal mobs.
  - Improved vfx and sfx.

Smash:
  - Deals 10 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Soulfire Nova:
  - Deals 8 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Sweep:
  - Deals 8 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Trapper:
  - Clouds now display a unique death message if you die to them.

Venom Nova:
  - Deals 8 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Webshot:
  - Uses player location to aim instead of direct forward motion.
  - Deals 6 damage. (Instead of fireworks)

Custom Statuses:

Bleeding:
  - Bleeding now only triggers if the mob has no invulnerability frames.
  - Likewise, its duration only decreases if the mob has no invulnerability frames.

Shocked:
  - Shocking only triggers if the mob has no invulnerability frames.
  - Likewise, its duration only decreases if the mob has no invulnerability frames.

Developer Commentary:
Under the new damage system, when multiple damage effects can trigger at the same time, unintended behavior can follow. 
This change is to limit and fix that unintended behavior. Effectively, this also prevents bleed and shocked from
interfering with vanilla minecraft invulnerability frames. 

Bug Fixes and Optimizations:
- New Shulker Boxes for Custom Enchantments to separate Repeating, Auto Charge, and Infinity further. This should eliminate (or at least drastically reduce) the chance of items being replaced improperly.
- Fixed a bug where Repeating only fired the first round of bolts as Multishot, if a Crossbow also had Multishot.
- Fixed potential bugs with Second Wind mis-activating on a newly respawned player.
- Fixed a bug where Infinity did not work on Golden Apples.
- Fixed a bug where Infinity returned the wrong items and overwrote other inventory slots.
- Fixed a bug where Conductive and Rend didn't work more than 160 blocks from 0,0.
- Fixed a bug where Hydraulic left behind permanent marker Armor Stands.
- Fixed a bug where items that were used or broken with Custom Enchantments still "existed" on the player, providing their effects.
- Fixed a bug where custom damage effects did less damage to Wither Skeletons and did not make the damage ca.flash.
- Fixed a bug where multiplayer token systems could cause more than 1 ability to activate at a time.

- About 60 or 70% of the @e calls have been removed from the pack. (Ballparking ~200 separate calls)
  - What does this mean? The pack should perform better under high stress environments.
  - This likely won't be noticeable for casual use, but it should hopefully mean that in extreme cases, Cartographer doesn't affect your tps.
  - This isn't a guarantee Cartographer cannot affect tps; all large datapacks can. But this will help edge cases a bit.

Version Beta 1.1 - The Shock and Awe Update (yeah I'm gonna give updates cutesy names, cause you know, why not)

As an overview, this new version boasts:
+ Almost double the Custom Enchantments on original 1.0 launch. This includes new Trident enchants, new Bow enchants, and more!
+ Multiple new mob abilities to test your mettle against. Soulfire Novas, Fireballs, Traps, and more!
+ Custom Statuses is now an official supported module, with a ca.current total of 6 custom status debuffs that can be applied to mobs!
+ New Enchantments that utilize the mechanics of Custom Statuses.
+ Handbooks for all modules, not just Custom Enchantments!
+ Bugs, there will probably be bugs too. But I've got the bug spray ready.


Detailed Change Log:
Additions:

Custom Statuses is an official module now, instead of a placeholder for the Stunned debuff!
- On the wiki page, its officially clarified you will need Custom Statuses to make any and all custom debuff enchants work properly.
- Added Bleed: A status effect that deals damage over time depending on the level.
  (Applying Bleed to an already Bleeding target increases the level, instead of refreshing the duration.)
- Added Shock: A status effect that deals damage over time, but in a small area around the Shocked target.
- Added Blindness support on enemies. Blindness reduces a mob's follow range by 90%.
- Added Vulnerability. Replacing "Bad Omen" on enemies, Vulnerability increases the damage enemies take from all damage instances by 1 per level.
- Added Rage. After a brief delay, this status effect aggros its victim on the nearest hostile enemy.

- Custom Statuses has an Advancement handbook page titled "Afflictions and Maladies" which details the effects of all custom statuses in game, if you find an item that utilizes them.

Custom Enchantments:
- There are now enchantments that offer compatibility with the new DoT effects in Custom Statuses.
  - Vicious / Rend: Give your melee attacks / arrows the ability to inflict Bleed.
  (Vicious has up to 3 levels, increasing the base duration of Bleed. Rend is single level, with a flat 5 second duration.)
  - Overload / Conductive: Give your melee attacks / arrows the ability to inflict Shocked.
  (Overload has up to 3 levels, increasing duration of Shocked. Conductive is single level, with a flat 5 second duration.)

- Additionally, there are enchantments that offer compatibility with Vulnerability.
  - Committed / Pin Down: Give your melee attacks / arrows Vulnerability.
  (Committed has up to 3 levels, increasing the potency of Vulnerability. Pin Down is a single level, 5 second duration, at Vulnerability II.)

- But that's not all. There are a couple of new melee specific Enchantments:
  - Echo: Striking an enemy has a chance to increase your attack speed briefly by 100%.
    (+20% chance per level to gain 1 second of faster attack speed).
  - Evocation: Killing an enemy has the chance to evoke the wrath of mysterious forces, which claw up from the ground and damage nearby foes.
    (25% increased chance per level, with a maximum of a 75% chance.)
  - Surging Strike: Strike further away from you with a sprint attack, dealing AoE damage in a line past your initial target.
    (+2 damage per level. Surging attacks strike foes that are up to 7 blocks away from the player.)

- There are new general passive Enchantments:
  - Energetic: When killing an enemy, grants Haste for 2 seconds per held/worn level. (Max of 12 seconds)
  - Soulbound: When dropped on death (and not destroyed), this item is immediately returned to your inventory when you respawn.
  - Spurs: When held or worn, walking into a cobweb instantly destroys it (Credit to GavstarB for this idea).

- And a new tool Enchantment:
  - Splintering: This Axe Enchantment causes barrels, doors, and trapdoors you break to stun nearby enemies!

- Bow and Crossbow Enchantments have gotten some new additions, inspired by CTM Community suggestions and Minecraft Dungeons!
  - Frost: Gives your arrows slowing properties.
  - Tempo Theft: Gives your arrows speed stealing properties.
  (Gain Speed when shooting a mob. Gain an increasingly more potent Haste effect at higher levels.)
  - Trueshot: Gives your arrows no gravity.
  - Volatile: Straps fireworks to your arrows to do AoE damage.

- As one final Crossbow addition, Flame now works on Crossbows. Flame on!

- Finally, Tridents have gotten their long needed lineup of Enchantments, besides "just Current".
  - Hydraulic: Trade the long range capabilities of a trident for a close ranged AoE shove attack.
  - Ricochet: Causes a stream of water to bounce from enemy to enemy.
  (Increasing bounce count per level.)
  - Tempest: Increases the damage of ranged throws per level.
  (+3 damage per level.)


Mob Abilities:
- An army of new active attacks join the front lines:
  - Fireball: After a brief channel, the mob creates and directs a fireball projectile towards the nearest player!
  - Soulfire Nova: After a channel, the mob drains the health of all nearby players, healing itself!
  - Trapper: After a brief channel, the mob throws out multiple snaring projectiles behind the player, which slow and hurt those who walk on them!

- There are multiple new death triggering abilities:
  - Spectral: Similar to Exalted foes, killing a Spectral enemy summons a shadowy guardian to take revenge!
    - Spectres are lower (well, than Exalted at least) health assassin type mobs that spawn in with the "Ambush" ability.
  - There are 4 new "Blood" effects. When an enemy with a Blood effect is killed, it applies a buff to nearby enemies!
    - Brutal Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and improve their damage.
    (Each slain Brutal foe applies +1 melee damage to nearby foes, up to +5 max)
    - Relentless Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and improve their move speed.
    (Each slain Relentless foe applies +10% speed to nearby foes, up to 50% max)
    - Devious Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and reset their cooldowns.
    (Enemies without cooldowns receive 10 seconds of Speed I instead)
    - Sacrificial Blood: Slightly heal nearby foes, and give them an Absorption shield.
    (Slain Sacrificial foes grant Absorption I for 60 seconds to nearby foes)
  (All Blood effects heal affected mobs by 4 health)

- Mob Abilities now has an Advancement handbook page titled "Enemy Observations".
- Enemy Observations fills out as you kill mobs with special abilities, detailing special abilities in the handbook page.


Changes:

Custom Enchantments:

- Current now gives a second of hidden Haste 10 when the trident returns to you.
  (This will make the attack cooldown faster when your trident returns, making it easier to hit the mob dragged to you.)

- Sharpshot and Point Blank have received scaling adjustments, as they were considerably outperforming Power.
  - Sharpshot now scales 50%/100%/150% increased damage per second of travel. (Was 100/200/300)
  - Point Blank now scales 70%/140%/210% at close range, reducing as the arrow travels for its first half second. (Was 120/240/360)
  - Point Blank's reduction has been scaled down by 50% (This means that outside of Point Blank's effective range, arrows remain unaffected, just like before).
  - Point Blank's reduction now reduces an arrow's damage up to 10%/20%/30% of Point Blank's effectiveness. (Was 0%/0%/0%).

  - To clarify, Sharpshot and Point Blank increase damage additively, in relation to a Bow's base damage.
  This means that the percentage is unaffected by Power. Power, Sharpshot, and Point Blank, do not affect each other.
  They can be stacked, but they do not increase each other's damage.

- Second Wind has been reworked (again, I swear one day I will get this enchant just right):
  Developer Note: This description of Second Wind is verbose and detailed. The enchantment's new description and a TLDR can be found beneath this list.
  - When you would take a lethal hit [from a mob], force Evasion to trigger.
  - Gain 8 Health in "Volatile Shielding" that lasts for 8 seconds.
  - If you kill a mob, immediately heal for the total remaining shield health. (The shield health will vanish).
  - If the shield health expires (runs out of time or is used up by attacks) it detonates, dealing damage to you and nearby mobs.
  
  - The more times this effect triggers in repeated instances, the less time Volatile Shielding lasts for. (Down to 2 seconds).
  - The more times this effect triggers in repeated instances, the more damage the detonation will do. (Up to 18 damage).

  - New Description:
  "With Evasion, If you would take a fatal hit from a mob, Evasion automatically triggers.
  You are then granted a "Volatile Shield" of 8 health for 8 seconds.
  If you lose that shielding, it detonates, hurting you.
  If you kill a mob, the shielding is defused, and you heal equal to the shielding's total.
  Repeated triggers of Second Wind in succession make the shielding less effective, and more dangerous."

  - TLDR: While the core idea of Second Wind (prolong your life by blocking lethal attack, in exchange for needing to kill mobs to avoid a penalty)
  is the same, the enchant has been streamlined and simplified to make it more responsive and effective.
  A penalty for repeated triggers has been added to prevent the enchantment from making a player immortal.

- Two Handed has been reworked:
  - No longer debuffs the player if an item is held in the offhand and mainhand.
  - Now affects entire hotbar (the curse effect will trigger so long as the Two Handed item is in the hotbar)
  - Two Handed now places an offhand item (while the Two Handed item is in the hotbar) in an "Item Knapsack".
    - The Item Knapsack remains in the offhand. (but can be moved)
    - When right clicked on the ground, the Item Knapsack is opened, placing the item it contains.
    - Items placed by knapsacks Glow, are Indestructible, and don't Despawn (until they are picked up)
    - While inside an Item Knapsack, an item has no effect on the player's stats. (Its enchants will not activate and its attributes will not change the player).
  
  - New Description:
  "When in the hotbar, this item packages and stores up any item placed in your offhand (rendering it ineffective)." 
  
  - TLDR: Two Handed no longer debuffs the player, and instead locks away any item placed in the offhand, preventing it from affecting your stats.

- Curse of Shattering now works on Netherite Items (Tools, Weapons, and Armor).

- The Handbook for Custom Enchantments has been renamed to "Arcane Notes". There have been minor formatting adjustments to the Arcane Notes handbook page.

Mob Abilities:
- Exalted now have properly set attributes. Their "new" stats are:
  - 60 Health
  - 0.26 Movement Speed (Slightly faster than a normal Zombie)
  - 1 Knockback Resistance
  - 12 Attack Damage
  - 40 Follow Range (Same as a normal Zombie)
  - (Exalted still have the "charge" ability).
- Exalted spawn Slowness and Weakness duration reduced to 3 seconds (was 5).
- Nova attack particles have been reworked. Each nova's attack particle will now display a ring of particles around the mob equivalent to the nova's attack range.
- Active Ability animations are now cancelled when a player walks out of range, instead of paused.
- Laser is now far more destructive and dangerous. Make sure to block that line of sight!

- Token Manager Changes:
  - The token manager will not grant a mob a token if they cannot currently see a player. (Active Ability animations will not start if the mob cannot see the player)
    - A mob *can* take a token from a player it is not attacking. But it cannot take a token from a player it could not physically see. (Due to a wall or obstruction)
    - Mobs can take tokens from players they are not directly looking at. (This has always been the case, just to help clarify things.)
    - This does not mean you are immune from attacks through walls. Novas for example will still deal damage to players within radius even if there are blocks obstructing them. (This will likely eventually change).
    - Helper Difficulty (score "helper_diff") now supports up to 5, in case you wanted to involve more panic.

Custom Statuses:
- Mob Abilities' Active Ability animations are now interrupted by the Stunned debuff.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed Stunned enemies reducing the duration of stun on other stunned enemies.
- Fixed Regeneration not working.
- Fixed Eruption not working.
- Fixed Current not removing drag tag on reeled in enemies. (Current will no longer push mobs away from you.)
- The Shulker Box relied upon to do item manipulation has been moved to 4206900 0 4206900. The chunk containing those coordinates is now constantly loaded.
  (Cartographer Core hopes everyone appreciates this nice meme.)
- Exalted now have properly set attributes. They will be much harder to kill. >:D
- Reflect Shields now properly slow, harden, and sturdify enemies (their attributes now work).

- Credits have been updated and modified to be more specific and accurate.

Hotfix: Version Beta 1.0.1
Bugs Fixed:
- World automatically places Shulker Box at 0 0 0 and sets world spawn there.
(Fixing all enchantments that rely on it, such as Auto Charge, Repeating, and Infinity.)
- Fixed token system for mob abilities not applying statistics to players.
(Active abilities should now work.)
- Fixed Custom Enchantmemts not creating "helper_arrow_dmg" scoreboard on reload.
(Sharpshot and Point Blank work again).

Thanks to Matt_97 and Gizmo for finding these bugs!



Initial Release: Version Beta 1.0
Established Changelog. All future changes to Cartographer, including additions, balance changes, and bug fixes, will be written here.
