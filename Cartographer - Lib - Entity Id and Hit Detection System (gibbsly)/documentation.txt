Entity hit detection utility
	This is a pack to detect what entity a player hit/killed, and/or what entity hit/killed a player.
	
	This also applies an ID to all entities that are not in the tag #entityid:id_skip. 
	
	IDs are stored on the scoreboard entityid as well as in the entities 'Tags' array bit by bit. This is formatted like "entityid.<bit_index>.<bit_value>".
	
	By default this pack will not attempt to run any checks on players, to start checking for damage you add 1 to the score "phe_listen" for "player_hurt_entity" and "ehp_listen" for "entity_hurt_player". To check for killing you add 1 to the score "pke_listen" for "player_killed_entity", and "ekp_listen" for "entity_killed_player". If you want to stop listening you remove 1 from the score you added to. This allows multiple systems to enable listening without having to track if any other system may be listening at the same time. 
	
	If the system is currently listening some function tags will be called if a player is hit or if a player hits an entity. These function tags are listed below. The attacker and receiver are tagged with entityid.<attacker|receiver>. The execution order is always entity/player/entity.
		"#player_hurt_entity/as_entity"		| runs as the entity that was hit by the player before any player handling happens
		"#player_hurt_entity/as_attacker"	| runs as the player when they attack an entity
		"#player_hurt_entity/as_receiver"	| runs as the entity that was hit by the player
		
		"#entity_hurt_player/as_entity"		| runs as the entity that hit the player before any player handling happens
		"#entity_hurt_player/as_receiver"	| runs as the player when hit by an entity
		"#entity_hurt_player/as_attacker"	| runs as the entity that hit the player
		
		"#player_killed_entity/as_attacker"	| runs as the player that killed an entity, there is no way to execute something as a dead entity
		
		"#entity_killed_player/as_entity"	| runs as the entity that killed the player before any player handling happens
		"#entity_killed_player/as_receiver"	| runs as the player when killed by an entity
		"#entity_killed_player/as_attacker"	| runs as the entity that killed the player
	
	
	This system has no context of what systems are currently requesting updates, so you will need to handle the logic of that yourself in your own systems.
	
	This system also writes the ID of the owner onto projectiles, any projectiles an attacker owns are tagged as "entityid.attacker.projectile" when a player receives damage
